# CAA Communication

This project is designed to facilitate communication within the CAA organization, leveraging Vue 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for a modern and efficient development experience.

## Recommended IDE Setup

We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension (and disabling Vetur) for the best development experience.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

To enable TypeScript support for `.vue` files, we use `vue-tsc` for type checking instead of the default `tsc` CLI. Ensure you have [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) installed in your editor to recognize `.vue` types.

## Customize Configuration

For project-specific configurations, refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
